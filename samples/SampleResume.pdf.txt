Career Goal:  I am seeking a summer internship in an industry or organization where I can apply my 
mathematical knowledge and my analytical/problem-solving abilities. I have augmented my mathematical 
studies with courses in computer science and I am interested in finding a position where I can combine 
mathematical analysis with numerical simulations.  
 
Education: 
The University of Arizona, 2008-present 
Major:  Mathematics. Minor: Computer Science 
GPA: 3.4, Major GPA: 3.5, Minor GPA: 3.4  
Expected graduation date: May 2012  
                                        
College credit earned in high school:  I earned college credit for first semester calculus. 
 
Computer skills: I have a solid general knowledge of computers as well as proficiency in Java and  C.   
 
Relevant coursework completed by May 2011:  
Mathematics courses:  Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Vector Calculus,  Introduction to Linear Algebra, Formal 
Mathematical Reasoning and Writing, and Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations, Complex Variables 
Computer science courses:  Introduction to Computer Science, Program Design and Development, and 
Object-Oriented Programming and Design  
Other Relevant Courses: Two semesters of Chemistry and one semester of Biology 
 
Work Experience:  
I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Fall 2010 for business math. My supervisor was Dr. W. 
Valentoso. I tutored algebra four hours per week and developed several Excel spreadsheets for the business 
mathematics course for Dr. Valentoso. I also held weekly review sessions for the students in his course. 
 
I held a Undergraduate Research Assistantship in Spring 2011 under the direction of Dr. Warren.  I am 
investigating the practicality of reconstructing phase information from images taken in two different focal 
planes (the near field and the far field). This research will continue into next academic year. 
 
Honors/Awards:  I received Honorable Mention for Fall Semester 2008 and was on the Dean’s List for the 
other semesters.  I am an out-of-state student and have been receiving out-of-state tuition waivers as a 
scholarship. I have also been part of the Honors College since my first year.   
 
Activities: Since Fall 2009, I have been a member of Math Cats, the Undergraduate Mathematics Club. I 
have participated in several outreach activities sponsored by this club. I am also a member of the Microsoft 
Student Users Group: A club dedicated to the discussion of programming technology and theory, both of 
Microsoft and in general. 
 
Volunteer Work:  I was a volunteer mathematics tutor at a middle school (five hours per week) during the 
academic year, 2009-2010.   
 
Citizenship:  USA
