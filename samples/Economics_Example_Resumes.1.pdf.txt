Resume Overview 
Your resume is a summary of your education, employment, internship experience, skills, volunteer experience, 
and research experience. Create an original document on Microsoft Word and avoid using templates. 
Employers review resumes is less than one minute, so ensure that your resume focuses on your relevant skills 
and experiences. The easier you make if for the employer to review, you increase the likelihood that you will 
receive an interview offer. 
 
Writing Your Resume 
Start writing your resume by reviewing examples. Example resumes will give you several ideas for content and 
formatting for your own resume. Once you create a resume draft, schedule an appointment with the Economics 
Career Advisor for a resume review. (See Economics Career Development Office website for information about 
scheduling an appointment).
