SKILLS  

 
EXPERIENCE  
Software Engineering Intern 

Yahoo! Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, May - August, 2015 

• Interned with the user data team, which is part of cloud services at Yahoo! 

Research Intern 

Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, TU Darmstadt, Germany, January - June, 2014 

• Developed an application (in Java) using the DKPro library to automatically solve multiple choice reading  comprehension 
questions. Using text similarity and textual entailment measures, it obtained the 2nd best score in the CLEF Entrance Exams 
competition. 

Research Student  

Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, July - December, 2013 

• Developed an application (in Python) to use a tree-based learning algorithm to model the deadline hit and  miss patterns of 

periodic real-time tasks. The algorithm used formal verification techniques to generate a regular language-based guarantee to 
predict future deadline hits and misses. 

Developer (Google Summer of Code) 

Student Developer for National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB), Summer 2012 

• Built an app (in Java) for Cytoscape, an open-source software for complex network visualization. The  app helped users to 

visually analyze and modify molecular interaction networks. 

 

 

 

 

 
PROJECTS  
MapReduce Engine 

Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2014 

Object Recognition Using CIFAR-10 Dataset 

Carnegie Mellon University, Fall 2014 

• Implemented a Hadoop-like MapReduce facility, with master and worker nodes for map-reduce operations over large datasets, 

with a distributed file system, and fault tolerance to address datanode failures. 

• As part of an in-class Kaggle competition, several approaches were tried to train a model using 4000 images for the 

CIFAR-10 dataset. With GIST descriptors and a Kernelized (RBF) SVM, a test accuracy of 61% was obtained on a dataset 
consisting of 15000 images. 

Intelligent Indoor Emergency Response System 

Carnegie Mellon University, Spring 2015 

• Developed a priority-based auctioning algorithm for task allocation in a multi-agent environment. Using  a modified A* 

algorithm, tasks were prioritized based on proximity to the location of the fire resulting  in an efficient evacuation.
