RESEARCH AND TEACHING EXPERIENCE 
 
Teaching Assistant, Smith College Astronomy Department, Northampton, MA, January 2012 – present 

Held evening lab hours weekly to assist in teaching laboratory material to students in introductory astronomy 
courses. Assisted in solar and night-time telescope observations for Smith faculty, students, and guests.  

 
Teaching Assistant, Smith College Physics Department, Northampton, MA, January 2011 – present 

Tutored students in a 3rd-year course, Thermal Physics, on a weekly basis. Helped students prepare for exams 
and homework assignments by going over concepts in thermal physics, statistical mechanics, and introductory 
physics. Graded problem sets for General Physics I, General Physics II, and Modern Physics I.  
 

Research Intern, University of St Andrews, St. Andrews, Scotland, August 2012 – February 2013 

Developed optimized process for particle clearing and trapping using optically-mediated Airy beams.  Wrote 
LabVIEW program with user interface that controlled experimental parameters. Conducted experiments using 
program, and employed MATLAB for data analysis.  Results showed that Airy beams successfully manipulated 
micro-particles.  Experimental procedure will be applied towards research involving optical sorting of animal 
cells and other biological material.  

 
Research Intern, University of Rochester REU Program, Rochester, NY, June 2012 – August 2013 

Researched adaptive optics and orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of light for a summer REU project. 
Set-up and performed several experiments to characterize the propagation of OAM states through turbulent 
media. Wrote LabVIEW and MATLAB programs for data collection and analysis.  Data suggested that OAM 
states are good candidates for quantum cryptography.
